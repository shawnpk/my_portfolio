<h1>Here I am.</h1>

<p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries, I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often, developers rearely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
<p>For this reason, I decided to utilize a completely different development patern that focuses on constant communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project, not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time and on budget.</p>
